# My Portfolio
 This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and journey as a Software Engineering student. Built with React.js, it features a modern, responsive design with sections for my resume, skills, projects, blog, and contact info. The site integrates with MongoDB for dynamic content management.
